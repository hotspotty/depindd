## About

### What is this network?

Founded in 2020, DIMO means Digital Infrastructure for Moving Objects and allows vehicle owners to collect, use, and monetize data from their vehicles. Developers and data consumers can build apps and services on this platform, which is built in the open with open-source components. DIMO lives on the Polygon blockchain (EVM-compatible) and establishes an open, blockchain-based identity for users and vehicles. Users can mint their car as an NFT, self-custody its data, and choose if and when they’d like to monetize said data. DIMO offers new opportunities for app developers and data consumers to make use of rich, verifiable data and build new app categories.

### How can I mine $DIMO tokens?

Getting involved with DIMO and getting started mining their $DIMO token can be facilitated through the DIMO Mobile app. Participants can either buy a hardware device or connect via their car’s app if it has one. The next step is to either connect the hardware device to your vehicle’s OBD2 port or connect via your car’s app such as FordPass or the Tesla app. After going through the onboarding process within the DIMO app, you just need to maintain this connection to begin collecting vehicle data and earning $DIMO tokens. The DIMO team is helping create an active developer ecosystem that will continuously generate new opportunities for earning tokens and capturing and then using vehicle data.

### Any geographical restrictions?

At the moment DIMO is only available in the United States, Canada, European Union, United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland. This is mainly to accommodate high density areas that will help develop the ecosystem.

There does seem to be strong interest from distributors and dealers in LATAM, Turkey/Middle East, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia/NZ, Southeast Asia so global expansion is inevitable if DIMO continues to grow.

### How can I optimize my mining rewards?

To fully optimize the mining rewards on DIMO you will need to ensure at least one weekly connection to the DIMO Mobile app by driving in your vehicle. This is currently a very low barrier to entry and for users who commute daily they can easily ensure connection to DIMO. The longer you’re continuously connected, the more baseline (weekly) rewards you can earn (up to a cap). As mentioned before once the ecosystem is built out there will be greater opportunities to earn $DIMO through their suite of apps and marketplaces.

### How can I use the network?

The DIMO network developer platform is growing quickly. Here are some of the current and coming soon use cases that utilize the connections to DIMO vehicles:

Available now:

- **Car valuation**: Provides an estimated valuation of your car and real-time offers.
- **Partner benefits and discounts**: Take advantage of services like Vehicle Genius, Tenet, and Caribou to save time and money
- **Health maintenance data**: Check up on your car with up to date data such as oil life, tire pressure, battery health, etc.
- **Digital glovebox**: Virtual space to keep your insurance card, title, registration, or any other car documentation.

Coming soon:

- **Dimo Connect**: A subscription mobile hotspot plan all through your DIMO device
- **Error codes**: Find out what issues your car might be having in real time
- **Maintenance alerts**: Allow for you to know how fuel you have left or if you need to fill up one of your tires with programmable alerts
- **Shared vehicle data sharing**: Host/Patron feature to allow for value from DIMO data to be derived by both parties

### Who governs this network?

The $DIMO token holders can create and vote on proposals called DIMO Improvement Proposals (DIPs) that have control over the network, upgrade DIMO smart contracts and token, and set aside tokens for grants. There are no limitations on what the DIMO community can vote on or do as it is built as a decentralized community. An exemplary situation of when the DIMO community brought forth productive change was through DIP-6 with the establishment of the legal entity, the DIMO Foundation. This provided a clear and transparent bridge from the decentralized community to the legacy world of business and regulation. In addition, DIP-6 set in place a framework that enacted important permissions to the foundation such as the smart contract admin, however, built the necessary checks and balances to only allow such permissions when authorized by governance votes.

## Data sources and calculations

### Average monthly USD earnings

[1,105,000 DIMO tokens issued each week in 2023](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/dip2) (only inclusive of baseline issuance, marketplace issuance not significant enough yet). Multiply by 4 to get to 4,420,000 DIMO tokens issued per month. Multiply by [current token price](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xe261d618a959afffd53168cd07d12e37b26761db&swapIndex=0). Divide by [current number of vehicle IDs](https://dune.com/dylan_dimo/dimo) (lower number than “vehicles connected” stat on DIMO explorer as some users connected vehicles before minting vehicle IDs as NFTs was possible and can’t receive rewards until they do).

Note: average monthly token rewards are likely higher than stated here, as not all vehicle IDs are actively connected and earning (see requirements above). This is not inclusive of the airdrop period for early contributors described [here](https://docs.dimo.zone/mainnet/airdrop/airdrop-total).

Calculation for 2023: 4,420,000 DIMO tokens issued per month (baseline issuance)*current token price/current number of vehicle IDs*current token price=average monthly USD earnings

### Average miner price

There is currently only one hardware device available, from [DIMO x AutoPi](https://shop.dimo.zone/products/dimo-data-device?title=default%2520title). This price was used for average miner price.

Note: software (app-only, generally free) connections are available for more modern cars. Check compatibility [here](https://explorer.dimo.zone/vehicles). Software connections significantly decrease payback period due to their reduced cost.
