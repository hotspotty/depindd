The DePIN ecosystem can be broken up in different building blocks, which we will call **DePIN LEGO** blocks, analogous to [DeFi LEGO](https://phemex.com/academy/defi-composability-money-lego). These LEGOs in turn have projects in different **categories**.

Projects in DePIN DD will follow this classification system. Learn more about each of these LEGOs and categories by clicking on the sections below:
