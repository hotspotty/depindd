## About

### What is this network?

Founded in 2019, the Helium Network is a blockchain-based, decentralized wireless network that allows people and devices to connect with the Internet. Participants who deploy wireless hardware on behalf of the network are rewarded with Helium's native token, HNT, as an incentive for maintaining and expanding the network's coverage.  It is known as "The People's Network" because it is owned and operated by the community of users rather than a centralized entity.

Helium initially launched with an IoT-focused network called LoRaWAN and enjoyed great success, motivating hundreds of thousands of people around the world to deploy nearly 1M “hotspots” providing IoT coverage.

The overarching network is not limited to IoT use cases and Helium is now expanding to other wireless technologies, including a CBRS-based cellular network and a future WiFi network. The project is flexible and future-proof, aiming to create a more affordable, efficient, and accessible method of building the wireless networks of the future.

### How can I mine $HNT tokens?

You can mine HNT tokens using an IoT hotspot. This involves purchasing a Helium hotspot device, which acts as a node on the network, and using it to provide wireless coverage to IoT devices or 5G cellular devices. Node operators are rewarded with HNT tokens for providing coverage and relaying data on the network.

### Any geographical restrictions?

The IoT network utilizes unlicensed spectrum in the sub GHz range, varying by country and region. Helium’s IoT network is currently active in 190 countries as this spectrum is generally free to use worldwide. You can check out Helium’s country-specific frequency list [here](https://docs.helium.com/lorawan-on-helium/region-plans).

### How can I optimize my mining rewards?

There are several ways you can optimize your mining rewards for Helium's IoT network:

1. Location: One of the most important factors in optimizing your mining rewards is the location of your Hotspot. For proof-of-coverage earnings, hotspots located in areas with too much existing coverage will earn less than hotspots that are providing non-redundant coverage in new areas. For data transfer earnings, being in a more densely populated area is likely better. You can use the Helium Explorer website or app to see the coverage and density of devices in your area.
2. Antenna Placement: The placement of your Hotspot's antenna can also impact your mining rewards. You should aim to position your antenna as high as possible with as few obstructions as possible to optimize your Hotspot's range and increase the chances of receiving and transmitting data from nearby devices.
3. Power and Internet Connectivity: Your Hotspot needs to be powered on and connected to the internet to be able to participate in mining rewards. Ensure your Hotspot has a stable and reliable internet connection and a backup power source to prevent any downtime or interruptions to your mining efforts.

Overall, the key to optimizing your mining rewards on Helium's IoT and 5G networks is to ensure your Hotspot is well-positioned, properly maintained, providing new or at least not overly redundant coverage, and actively participating in the network. By maximizing your Hotspot's coverage and network participation, you can increase your chances of earning rewards and contributing to the growth of the Helium network.

### How can I use the network?

The main way to use the Helium Network is to connect devices (IoT sensors, cell phones) to the Internet. IoT use cases include asset tracking, temperature monitoring, or any low-bandwidth transmission.

### Who governs this network?

To facilitate community participation in the network's governance, Helium has implemented a unique governance model known as the [Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP)](https://github.com/helium/HIP) process. The HIP process allows stakeholders to submit proposals for network improvements, which are then reviewed and [voted on by other stakeholders](https://heliumvote.com/). This process ensures that the network's stakeholders have a say in its development and ensures that the network evolves in a decentralized and community-driven manner.

Furthermore, Helium's network is designed to be open and transparent, with all network activity and data recorded on the network's blockchain, which is publicly accessible. This ensures that the network's operations and decisions are open to public scrutiny, promoting transparency and accountability.
