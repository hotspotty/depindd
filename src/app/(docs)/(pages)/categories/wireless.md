## About

Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) networks aim to revolutionize the way communication networks are built and operated. Compared to traditional providers, DeWi networks achieve superior unit economics due to the reduction in CapEx and OpEx and elimination of spectrum licensing costs.

### 5G

“5G” stands for fifth generation and represents the newest standard for cellular connectivity. It can use a wide range of spectrum, from <3 GHz on the low end to >100 GHz on the high end. 5G networks are generally higher bandwidth (operate at a higher GHz level), higher throughput (can carry more data at once), and lower latency (less delay) than their 4G predecessors. The usage of higher bandwidth generally means that the signal from 5G radios doesn’t extend nearly as far as the signal from 4G radios, meaning 5G networks will need to be built out using more radios placed closer together.

5G networks’ need for more, smaller radios to be deployed drastically increases deployment and network buildout costs for centralized players and therefore lends itself very well to a decentralized wireless model that allows contributors to deploy small radios on their own property.

### LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is a type of LPWA (low power, wide area) network that provides low-bandwidth connectivity (small amounts of data transfer at a time) over a large radius (up to 10 miles in line of sight), typically for small sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It uses unlicensed (open to the public) spectrum that generally ranges from 863 to 928 MHz (0.863 to 0.928 GHz). Unlike cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G) or WiFi networks, you’d never be able to watch Netflix on a LoRaWAN network. There is simply too much data being transferred at once for the network to handle. But, you could transfer water quality sensor data once a day across a 7 mile radius for a year incredibly cheaply and efficiently.

{% internal-link title="Helium" href="/projects/helium-iot" / %} built the [first global IoT network](https://explorer.helium.com) using the LoRaWAN protocol, kickstarting the DePIN space as a whole. It still remains to be seen if this large, multinational network will see enough demand to justify its existence.

### WiFi

WiFi networks use 2.4, 5, and 6 GHz spectrum to provide high bandwidth (you can watch Netflix) connectivity in a relatively confined area (one WiFi router doesn’t provide miles of range).

WiFi provides a viable option for cellular network offload (consumers can use WiFi rather than cellular networks when they are in range) and WiFi networks are built out in many parts of the world.

WiFi provides an interesting opportunity for DeWi networks as the hardware is cheap to purchase, easy to install, and provides cellular-like connectivity.

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth networks use 2.4 GHz spectrum (similar to WiFi) but with far less transmit power, so their range is generally less than that of WiFi networks. Bluetooth use cases include streaming audio, sending pictures/videos, and providing entry/exit access to buildings. Bluetooth can also be used for some IoT-based applications.

Bluetooth has seen far less interest from DeWi projects than other types of networks but there are a few building on top of the protocol.
