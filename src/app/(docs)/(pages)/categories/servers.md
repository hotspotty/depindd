## Subcategories

### Compute

Compute Networks can be divided into two main classifications: general purpose (GP) compute networks and specific purpose (SP) compute networks. GP compute networks provide computing resources that can be used for a variety of applications. SP compute networks are tailored to specific use cases such as transcoding, rendering, and machine learning.
