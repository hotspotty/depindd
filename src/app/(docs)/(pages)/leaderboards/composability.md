As DePIN is designed to build out real infrastructure, some DePIN projects can make use of the infrastructure that other DePIN projects are providing. This illustrates the **composability** of the DePIN ecosystem. Composability allows developers to use existing building blocks to create entirely new applications, or in this case DePIN networks, without having to start over every time. Learn more about composability [here](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703067213066244) and [there](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/). The above table lists projects that are being used by other DePIN projects.
