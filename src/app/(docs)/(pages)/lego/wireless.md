### Connectivity

Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) networks aim to revolutionize the way communication networks are built and operated. Compared to traditional providers, DeWi networks achieve superior unit economics due to the reduction in CapEx and OpEx and elimination of spectrum licensing costs. Across dozens of DeWi projects, cellular, WiFi, LoRaWAN, Bluetooth, positioning, and hybrid networks are being built. The largest and most immediate opportunity lies in the 5G cellular market with Helium and XNET leading the charge.
